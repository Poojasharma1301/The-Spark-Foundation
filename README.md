## TASK 1 : Prediction using Supervised Machine Learing
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. The training data is given which is to be used to train the machine learning algorithm, then plot the actual vs predicted values, evaluate the model and visualise the data. The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and scikit-learn.
## TASK 2 : Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Here, we have to predict the optimum number of clusters of the given Iris dataset. It is prediction using unsupervised machine learning and we do this by KMeans Clustering and elbow method. The elbow is where the optimum number of clusters occur. The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.
## TASK 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
Here , We have to Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.And as a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit and also find out What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.

This is a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation: Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) in the Data Science and Business Ananlytics domain.
